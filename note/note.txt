// createBrowserRouter to create a new Router object we passin a array

// [{
// path : "/",
// element:<Home/>,
// errorElement:<Error/>,
// children : [
//     {
//         index:1,
//         element:<Landing/>
//     },{
//         path:"about",
//         element:<About/>
//     }
// ]

// }]



// react portion! 

// using redux js

// createStore() deprecated method not at all a good way to use redux

// inside this create we need to add reducer function like the one we created in useReducer hook of react

// configureStore we add the different slices we have created


we have to create a path 

/dashboard/ --> would be for AddJob Page 
/dashboard/all-jobs  --> would be for all jobs
/dashboard/profile --> would be for profile.jsx element 
/dashboard/admin --> for admin page



on the header link page we would add <Outlet /> component from react router dom

Dashboard --> page would not only have outlet component but it will have SmallSidebar BigSidebar and Navbar

here small and big sidebar would be visible according to screen sizes but navbar would be always visible!


now we will try to create a context using createContext and useContext of react!

also we will manage two states show Sidebar for toggling sidebar functionality and also isDrakTheme to implement dark mode functionality

we create a utils folder inside src and create a file --> links.jsx

.custom of express signifies custom validation!
